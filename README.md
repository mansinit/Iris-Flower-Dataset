# Iris-Flower-Dataset

In this python code, I first plotted a count plot of all the species and then convert the categorical variables.
By finding the correlation I got to know which attribute is affecting the most which result in the petal width.
Now by dividing the dataset into training and testing data, I applied three models decision tree classification, logistic regression and naive bayes which gives almost 96% accuracy which is good enough without doing anything.
